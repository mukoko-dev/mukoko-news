## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Account-backed saves & likes.** Engagement is now keyed to the signed-in WorkOS user (`user:<id>` subject key) instead of only the anonymous `mukoko_session` cookie, so saved articles and likes follow the account across devices. On the first signed-in interaction (or `/saved` read), anonymous cookie history is claimed for the user — overlaps keep the user's copy (`src/lib/engagement.ts`). `/saved` shows a "sign in to sync" nudge to anonymous readers. The document field stays `sessionId` (an opaque subject key to the gateway/pipeline); counts and aggregation are unchanged.
- **Developing-story timeline (`/topic/[slug]`).** The Mzizi `nyuchi-timeline` date-railed surface: everything published on a topic in the last 30 days, grouped by day (CAT) with time/title/source rows and thumbnails. Backed by `getTopicTimeline` (matches tag slugs/names, AI categories, and AI keywords) via `getTopicTimelineAction`, ISR-cached (`revalidate = 300`). Reached from new **"Follow the story" tag chips** on the article page and the Insights **trending topics** (previously a plain search link).
- **Mzizi density system adopted** (`globals.css`): the prime-scale **touch targets** (`--touch-*`: 47px primary / 43px inputs / 37px dense / 31px chips / 56px hero-only), the **icon scale** (`--icon-*`), and density scopes — `comfortable` is the default; `/admin` and `/dashboard` opt into `compact` via `data-density`, which cascades through `--density-touch` and the card/input radii with no per-component changes. Button sizes now ride the touch tokens.
- **Durable rate limiting.** `checkRateLimit` is now async and enforces a **global** fixed window via the Upstash Redis REST API when `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL`/`UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` are set (no SDK dependency, 1.5s timeout, fails OPEN to the in-memory limiter). Without them, behaviour is unchanged (per-instance in-memory window).

### Changed

- **Sign-in is the WorkOS-HOSTED AuthKit page (owner correction 2026-07-09 — supersedes the 2026-07-02 inline-form doctrine).** Every sign-in entry point (`/sign-in`, `/admin`, `/dashboard`, `/profile`, the publisher claim form) now funnels through `/sign-in` → `/auth/login` → the hosted page. The hosted page owns the whole flow — Magic Auth, passwords, passkeys, and the environment-required **MFA step-up** — and maintains the shared AuthKit session on the auth domain, giving **continuous sign-in across the Mukoko/Nyuchi apps** (all AuthKit applications in one WorkOS environment). See `auth.md`.
- `/sign-in` renders a manual-retry error card when the OAuth callback fails (no auto-redirect loop); already-signed-in users still skip straight to `returnTo`.

### Added

- **AuthKit initiate-login endpoint** `GET /auth/login` (`src/app/auth/login/route.ts`) — the WorkOS application's `initiateLoginUri` points here; redirects into a fresh hosted sign-in (used by IdP-initiated flows and hosted-page restarts). Previously 404'd.

### Fixed

- **MFA sign-in failures.** The environment enforces `MFA = Required`, and the inline form's hand-rolled TOTP challenge/enrolment (`workos.multiFactorAuth`) on the critical path is what kept breaking sign-in. The hosted page handles MFA natively.
- **`getSignInUrl()` during page render.** `getSignInUrl()` writes the PKCE/state cookie, and Next.js only allows cookie writes in a Server Action or Route Handler — calling it while rendering `/sign-in` threw (`Cookies can only be modified in a Server Action or Route Handler`), leaving the page on its "Sign-in unavailable" fallback. `/sign-in` now delegates to the `/auth/login` Route Handler, the only `getSignInUrl()` call site. (This same constraint is why the old inline page's hosted fallback link silently never rendered.)

### Removed

- The embedded inline AuthKit sign-in form (`src/components/auth/inline-sign-in.tsx`) and its Magic Auth / MFA Server Actions (`requestEmailCode`, `verifyEmailCode`, `verifyMfaCode`, `MfaState`). `src/lib/auth/actions.ts` keeps `isSignedIn()` and `signOutAction()`.
- The `TODO(on-primary)` markers in the error pages — the buttons now use the `text-on-primary` token instead of hardcoded white.

## [5.5.0] - 2026-07-03

### Added

- **Agent-readiness / AI-agent discovery.** Makes `news.mukoko.com` discoverable and usable by AI agents (tracks the isitagentready.com checklist). Shared values in `src/lib/agent-discovery.ts` mirror the gateway's real MCP/OAuth config. See `docs/agent-readiness.md`.
  - **MCP Server Card** (SEP-1649) at `/.well-known/mcp/server-card.json` — points agents at the MCP server (`news.mukoko.dev/mcp`), tool capability, auth hint.
  - **OAuth discovery** — `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server` (RFC 8414, mirrors the WorkOS issuer `identity.nyuchi.com` + PKCE) and `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` (RFC 9728).
  - **`/auth.md`** — agent authentication guide (served as `text/markdown`); honest about the flow (public MCP client + authorization-code/PKCE, no open DCR).
  - **Markdown for Agents** — `src/middleware.ts` rewrites `GET` requests with `Accept: text/markdown` (and not `text/html`) for `/` and `/article/[id]` to `/api/agent-md`, which returns a clean markdown representation (`Content-Type: text/markdown` + `x-markdown-tokens`, `Vary: Accept`). Browsers keep the HTML page. Implemented in-app because the site runs on Vercel (Cloudflare's auto-markdown doesn't apply).
  - **WebMCP** — `src/components/agent/webmcp-provider.tsx` registers in-browser tools (`search_mukoko_news`, `get_latest_headlines`, `open_article`) via `navigator.modelContext`, backed by the same Server Actions the UI uses (no secrets client-side).
  - **`/llms.txt`** pointing agents at the above.
  - **Infra (documented, not code)** in `docs/agent-readiness.md`: DNS-AID SVCB records + DNSSEC for the `mukoko.com` zone.

## [5.4.0] - 2026-07-03

### Added

- **Verified-publisher dashboard (`/dashboard`).** A self-service home for approved media houses (gated to verified publishers; others are routed to the claim flow or a "claim under review" state). Server-rendered gate (`src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`) + client dashboard (`src/components/publisher/dashboard/publisher-dashboard.tsx`) backed by gateway Server Actions (`src/lib/publisher/dashboard.ts`):
  - **Trust score breakdown** — the headline: average trust across the org's feeds plus the levers a publisher controls (share of articles with a cover image, with full content, and successfully processed), each with a progress bar and an actionable hint when it needs attention.
  - **Your feeds** — per-source health, trust score, article counts, last-fetch errors, and a **"Submit a feed directly"** form (Google-News style): hand us a full-content feed URL and we ingest it automatically (staff-reviewed, marked pending) instead of scraping.
  - **Organization profile** — inline edit of name/website/description (verification/trust fields are never editable).
  - **Analytics** — article volume, last-30-days, and view/like/save totals.
  - Reached from the `/profile` **Publisher dashboard** card (which now points at `/dashboard`).
- **Publisher verification — claimant + admin surfaces (Tier 2).** The frontend half of the two-tier trust model (the gateway owns the engine + trust boost).
  - **Claim your publication** (`/publishers/claim`, `src/components/publisher/publisher-claim-form.tsx`) — a signed-in user asserts they represent a news source. Submission is a Server Action (`src/lib/publisher/actions.ts`) that proxies to the gateway's authenticated `POST /api/user/publisher-claims` (the gateway resolves the claimant's identity and writes the `submitted` claim — the frontend never crosses the identity-domain boundary). Unauthenticated users see the inline sign-in first.
  - **Admin review queue** (`/admin/publishers`, `src/components/admin/publisher-claims-review.tsx`) — reads pending claims from MongoDB (`getPublisherClaims` in `src/lib/mongodb/admin.ts`) and approves/rejects them through the gateway (`approvePublisherClaim`/`rejectPublisherClaim` in `src/lib/admin/gateway.ts`). New "Publishers" entry in the admin nav.
  - **Verified-publisher badge on `/sources`** — `getSources` now `$lookup`s `newsMediaOrganizations` so the directory badges sources whose organization has passed Tier-2 verification.

### Changed

- **`/profile` redesign + de-duplication.** Collapsed the logged-out screen to a single inline sign-in flow (was two redundant buttons), replaced the gradient avatar with a brand-compliant solid `container-tanzanite` fill + initials (the brand forbids gradients on surfaces), and added a **Publisher** card linking to the claim flow.

## [5.3.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added

- **On-site MFA (TOTP) step-up for inline sign-in.** When an account has MFA enabled, WorkOS returns an `mfa_challenge` / `mfa_enrollment` step-up after a correct Magic Auth code. `src/lib/auth/actions.ts` now resolves it (`verifyEmailCode` challenges the enrolled TOTP factor, or enrols a new one and returns its QR; new `verifyMfaCode` completes the second factor via `authenticateWithTotp`), and `inline-sign-in.tsx` renders the authenticator-code step on-site — no hosted redirect. See `auth.md`.
- **Segmented 6-box one-time-code input** shared by the emailed Magic Auth code and the authenticator code (auto-advance, paste, backspace, arrow keys).

### Changed

- `InlineSignIn` reworked into a three-step flow (email → code → MFA); MFA enrolment shows a scannable QR + manual secret fallback.

## [5.2.0] - 2026-06-27

### Changed

- **Brand refresh: Mukoko "Swarm" identity** (doctrine v4.1.0). Replaces the Nyuchi Brand v6 styling.
  - **Palette**: full **7 African Minerals** palette (cobalt, tanzanite, malachite, gold, terracotta, sodalite, copper) — each with light/dark + container/on-container values — added as theme-aware CSS variables in `src/app/globals.css` and exposed as Tailwind utilities. `--primary`=tanzanite, `--secondary`=cobalt, `--accent`=gold, `--success`=malachite, `--warning`=terracotta. Cobalt-dark corrected to `#00B0FF`.
  - **Mark**: new **Seed-of-Life** mark (7 hexes, tanzanite core) drives the header logo (`AppIcon` now renders `mukoko-mark-full-{light,dark}.svg`).
  - **App icons + favicon**: new full-palette app icons on deep tanzanite (`public/mukoko-appicon.png` + `-paper`/`-mono-tanzanite`), mono-tanzanite favicon set (`favicon.svg`, `favicon-dark.svg`, `favicon-{16,32,48,180}.png`), and Seed-of-Life lockups. `manifest.json` / layout metadata / theme-color updated (`#4B0082`).
  - **Typography**: body now **Noto Sans** (was Plus Jakarta Sans); headings stay **Noto Serif**; **JetBrains Mono** added for code/data. Wordmark is lowercase Noto Serif 600.

## [5.1.1] - 2026-06-27

### Fixed

- **Feed categories & keywords now read from the `engagement` subdocument**: `toArticle` resolves the display category from `engagement.interest_categories` (falling back to `articleSection`) and maps `engagement.tags` → `keywords` — handling both string- and object-shaped elements. Previously every article showed as **"general"** because the category was read from `articleSection`, which the RSS collector hardcodes.
- **Raw HTML no longer leaks into the article body**: new `stripHtml()` util (block tags → newlines, tags removed, common entities decoded, `script`/`style` dropped) cleans `content` in `toArticle`; the detail view drops empty paragraphs. Hardened against the CodeQL incomplete-multi-character-sanitization finding. +7 `stripHtml` unit tests.

### Added

- **"Read original" button** on the article page linking to the source URL.

### Notes

- Cross-repo (gateway/pipeline) work shipped alongside this release: the gateway migrated off the decommissioned `mukoko-news-api` Worker to **direct MongoDB reads + a fly-worker collection trigger**, consolidated to a single `POST /api/refresh`, and added a platform-team-gated **`trigger_enrichment` MCP tool**; the fly-worker's RSS fetch interval is now tunable via `RSS_COLLECTION_INTERVAL_MINUTES`. See the `mukoko-news-gateway` and `mukoko-news-pipeline` repos.

## [5.1.0] - 2026-06-21

### Changed

- **Three-repo split**: This repository (`nyuchi/mukoko-news`) is now the Next.js frontend only.
  - Gateway (Cloudflare Workers API + MCP) → [`nyuchi/mukoko-news-gateway`](https://github.com/nyuchi/mukoko-news-gateway)
  - Pipeline (Fly.io + Cloudflare processing) → [`nyuchi/mukoko-news-pipeline`](https://github.com/nyuchi/mukoko-news-pipeline)
- **Data access**: Pages now use MongoDB Server Actions (`src/lib/actions/feed.ts`) directly — no Cloudflare Worker API calls for reads
- **CI**: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` reduced to `lint` + `test-frontend` jobs only
- **CLAUDE.md**, **README.md**, **CONTRIBUTING.md**, **SECURITY.md**: Rewritten to reflect frontend-only scope

### Removed

- `backend/`, `database/`, `mcp-package/` — moved to `nyuchi/mukoko-news-gateway`
- `fly-worker/`, `processing/`, `fundi-news-enrichment/`, `image-worker/` — moved to `nyuchi/mukoko-news-pipeline`
- `api-schema.yml`, `tsconfig.cloudflare.json`, `worker-configuration.d.ts` — gateway-specific
- `Dockerfile`, `fly.toml`, `docker-entrypoint.js` — pipeline-specific
- `scripts/dev-local.sh`, `scripts/generate-sitemap.js`, `test-backend-api.sh` — no longer applicable
- `.cloudflare/workers.json`, `.wranglerignore`, `.dockerignore` — not needed in frontend repo
- `plan.md` — stale planning document
- Root-level npm scripts for backend/pipeline (`dev:backend`, `build:backend`, `deploy:api`, etc.)

### Fixed

- Test mocks updated: `sources-page.test.tsx`, `embed-iframe.test.tsx`, `discover-page.test.tsx` now mock `@/lib/actions/feed` (Server Actions) instead of the removed `@/lib/api`
- `tsconfig.json` `exclude` list cleaned of non-existent directories

---

## [5.0.0] - 2026-06-15

### Added

- **newsdata.io ingestion** (pipeline): New collector runs every 6 h, ingesting articles from 16 African countries. Probes 9 RSS paths on new sources — creates active `feedSource` if found, inactive placeholder otherwise.
- **MongoDB Atlas search indexes**: `articles_vector_search` (1024-dim BGE-M3 cosine) and `articles_text_search` (lucene.english fuzzy). Related articles and search now use Atlas search with regex fallback.
- **MCP server v2.0.0**: Task-based tools supporting country codes (ZW, KE), region names, and city names. Tools: `get_briefing`, `track_story`, `get_location_news`, `compare_locations`, `get_source_view`, `find_stories`, `get_my_feed`, `get_trending_analytics`, `detect_surge`, `get_content_analytics`.
- **Sources page** (`/sources`): Full directory of all news sources with stats, filtering, and sorting.
- **New tests**: `src/lib/__tests__/rate-limit.test.ts`, `src/lib/__tests__/refresh.test.ts`.

### Security

- **IDOR fixes**: Four `/api/user/*` handlers replaced query-param userId with identity from verified JWT.
- **Admin gate**: Feed source initialization now requires admin role.
- **Input clamping**: View endpoint clamps `reading_time` (0–3600 s) and `scroll_depth` (0–100%).

### Fixed

- Fly.io app name corrected in configuration.

---

## [4.0.2] - 2026-01-24

- **Mobile Bottom Navigation**: Quick access to Home, Discover, NewsBytes, Search, Profile
- **Breadcrumb Navigation**: Clear navigation hierarchy on article pages
- **Country Selector Integration**: Country selection filters the news feed
- **Centralized Constants**: Countries and categories in `src/lib/constants.ts`
- **BASE_URL Utilities**: `getArticleUrl()` and `getFullUrl()` for consistent URL generation
- **JSON-LD XSS Prevention**: Unicode escaping for `<`, `>`, `&` in structured data
- **safeCssUrl Utility**: Centralized CSS `url()` builder in `src/lib/utils.ts`
- **Security Test Suite**: Injection and attack vector tests (+38 security tests)

### Fixed

- XSS vulnerabilities in Avatar, NewsBytes, and JSON-LD components
- Memory leak in article page share timeout cleanup
- SSR safety: fixed `window.location` usage in server context
- Stale closure in pull-to-refresh (now uses ref pattern)
- O(n²) keyword cloud rendering — memoized
- Breadcrumb keys use stable `href || label`, not array index
- Bottom nav routing uses anchored regex to match exact article paths

### Changed

"Ndiri nekuti tiri" — I am because we are
