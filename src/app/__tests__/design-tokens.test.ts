/**
 * globals.css must not drift from Mzizi.
 *
 * The audit that produced this file found seventeen tokens disagreeing with the
 * design system or missing outright, and the drift was invisible because
 * nothing compared them. Two were not cosmetic:
 *
 *  - `--surface`/`--card` in dark mode carried Mzizi's `muted` (#050504, the
 *    DEEPEST fill) rather than `surface` (#131211). Since `--muted` is also
 *    #050504, a card and the inset row inside it were the same colour — the
 *    metadata well had no edge at all.
 *  - All twelve `--chart-*` values were raw Tailwind palette (violet-500,
 *    teal-600, gray-400, rose-600 …) sitting in `:root` where they looked
 *    official. Insights and Analytics draw every chart from them, and
 *    `--chart-negative` was orange-700 in light and rose-600 in dark, so a
 *    negative series changed hue with the theme.
 *
 * SNAPSHOT is a checked-in copy of the values read from the Mzizi MCP
 * (`mzizi_get_tokens`) on 2026-09-10. It is refreshed DELIBERATELY — by
 * re-querying the MCP and updating this file in a reviewed change — never by
 * relaxing an assertion to match whatever globals.css happens to say. A failure
 * here means one of the two moved, and which one it was is the reviewer's call.
