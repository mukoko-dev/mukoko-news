/**
 * The live coverage figure, resolved once per render pass and shared.
 *
 * ## Why a context rather than a fetch per component
 *
 * Four client components state the coverage claim — `/about`, `/discover`,
 * `/sources` and the WebMCP tool descriptions. Each could call the Server
 * Action itself, but that is four round trips for one number that is identical
 * across all of them, on a platform whose readers are mostly on metered African
 * mobile connections. Worse, they would resolve at different moments, so a
 * reader could briefly see two different counts on the same screen.
 *
 * The root layout is a Server Component and can await the value during its own
 * render, so it resolves once and every client component below reads it
 * synchronously. No fetch, no waterfall, no flash of a stale number.
 *
 * ## This does not make the app dynamic
 *
 * `getLiveCoverageAction` reads through `unstable_cache`, not through `cookies()`
 * or `headers()`. Awaiting it in the root layout is a cached data read, so
 * routes stay statically renderable — unlike `withAuth()`, which is deliberately
 * kept out of the root layout for exactly that reason (see `user-avatar.tsx`).

 * The coverage figure for a client component.

 * Falls back to the pinned constant rather than throwing when no provider is
 * present. A missing provider is a wiring mistake, and the cost of that mistake
 * should be a slightly stale number in one paragraph — not a crashed page tree.
 * Tests that render a single component in isolation get the same treatment.
