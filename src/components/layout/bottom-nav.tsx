/**
 * The floating island.
 *
 * ## Every device, not just the phone
 *
 * It used to be `md:hidden` — a phone bar, with a separate action bar taking
 * the bottom edge on desktop. Two components doing one job, and only one of
 * them ever visible, which is how the desktop bar shipped left-anchored and
 * with an invisible Share button for a week without anyone noticing. There is
 * one island now and it is on every screen (owner decision 2026-09-11).
 *
 * ## Fixed ends, contextual middle
 *
 * `[ Feed | …the page's own actions… | Profile ]`
 *
 * The two ends never move: a control that shifts under your thumb between
 * pages is worse than no control. Everything between belongs to the page —
 * an article puts like, save, share and open-at-the-publisher there through
 * `useIslandActions`. A page that contributes nothing falls back to the three
 * destinations a thumb reaches for constantly, so the island is never a gap.
 *
 * ## Where it sits on a desktop
 *
 * Centred on the CONTENT COLUMN, not the viewport — when the sidebar is docked
 * the island shifts right with the page, so it stays over what you are reading
 * instead of straddling the sidebar's edge. That offset is a CSS rule keyed off
 * `data-sidebar` (see `globals.css`), the same mechanism that insets the shell,
 * because it has to be right on the first paint after a reload.
 *
 * ## Shape
 *
 * A **pill** (`rounded-full`), not a docked bar. It floats because this is a
 * web app rather than an installed one: there is no OS-drawn tab bar to sit
 * flush against, and a full-width bar welded to the bottom of a browser
 * viewport collides with the browser's own toolbar and the home-indicator
 * gesture zone. `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` is what clears the latter, and
 * `viewport-fit=cover` in `layout.tsx` is what makes that inset non-zero.
