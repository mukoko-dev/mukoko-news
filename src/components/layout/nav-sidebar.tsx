/**
 * The app's full navigation, as a sidebar.
 *
 * ## Docked, not a dropdown
 *
 * From `lg` up this is a real sidebar: it holds layout space (the shell is
 * inset by `--sidebar-width`), it does not close when a destination is chosen,
 * and it survives navigation and reload. A reader opens it once and moves
 * around the app with it there, which is the entire difference between a
 * sidebar and a menu — a menu that closes on every click is a dropdown, and
 * this was one until an owner review said so.
 *
 * Below `lg` there is no room for a 17rem column beside the content, so it
 * overlays: scrim, focus trap, scroll lock, closes on navigation. Those four
 * belong to the overlay ONLY. Docked, a focus trap would strand a keyboard
 * reader inside a panel that is simply part of the page, and a scroll lock
 * would freeze a document that nothing is covering.
 *
 * ## One DOM tree, not two
 *
 * The two modes are the same markup reshaped by responsive classes plus an
 * `isDocked` flag, never two subtrees taking turns behind `lg:hidden`. jsdom
 * applies no media queries, so both would render in every test and each
 * `getByRole` would match twice — the trap the deleted article action bar was
 * the cautionary tale for.
 *
 * The landmark role changes with the mode, and that is correct rather than
 * clever: docked it is a `navigation` region the reader can Tab through as
 * part of the page; overlaid it is a modal `dialog` that owns focus until
 * dismissed. Announcing a docked sidebar as a modal dialog would be a lie.
