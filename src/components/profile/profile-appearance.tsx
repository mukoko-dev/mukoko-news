/**
 * Appearance: theme and component outlines, both picked by looking.
 *
 * ## Why these are previews and not a switch
 *
 * Outlines used to be a lone toggle with a paragraph explaining what it did,
 * and the theme was a *cycle button* somewhere else on the page that showed
 * only its current value — a reader had to tap it three times to find out what
 * the options even were, and never saw two of them side by side. Both are
 * purely visual settings, so the honest control is the thing itself: each
 * option renders a miniature of the app in that setting. "Dark" is a picture
 * of dark; "Outlines on" is a picture of a card with an edge.
 *
 * Putting them in one card is the other half of it. They are the same
 * decision — how the app looks — and they interact: outlines matter more in a
 * theme where the surface steps sit closer together. Two controls in two
 * places, one of them a cycle button labelled "Appearance", was three taps and
 * a guess.
 *
 * Rendered for signed-out readers too: both are rendering preferences stored
 * on the device, and gating an accessibility control behind a sign-in makes it
 * unreachable for the readers most likely to need it.
 *
 * ## The one-frame question
 *
 * Both values are read in an effect, which is a paint too late — but the
 * pre-paint bootstrap in `layout.tsx` has already set the class and the
 * attribute, so the PAGE is never wrong. This only syncs the controls to it,
 * from the same helpers the bootstrap mirrors.
